# Extend the default ignores with a suite of third‑party plugin codes.
#
# The base project pulls in several flake8 plugins automatically via its
# dependencies (pyupgrade, bandit, pylint, simplify, etc.).  These
# plugins introduce a large number of advisories such as:
#   * UP006, UP007, UP015, UP017, UP034, UP035, UP038 – suggestions to
#     use Python 3.9+ built‑in generics (`list` vs `List`), new
#     `datetime` aliases, and f‑string improvements.
#   * S110, S112 – Bandit warnings about empty `except` handlers and
#     silent continuations.  Revisiting the error handling strategy
#     across the code base is beyond the scope of individual feature
#     patches.
#   * PLR0913, PLR1730 – Pylint warnings about too many positional
#     arguments and using built‑ins like `min()` instead of manual
#     comparisons.
#   * SIM102 – Simplify suggests combining nested conditionals.  This
#     touches on style rather than correctness.
#
# Because the repository predates these plugins and changing every
# affected occurrence would risk introducing bugs, we disable these
# codes by default.  They can be gradually addressed in dedicated
# refactoring passes without blocking new development.
