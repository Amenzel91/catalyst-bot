        # Keep it sane: Black-friendly ignores + extended list of
        # third‑party plugin codes to suppress.  Flake8 loads several
        # optional plugins implicitly (pyupgrade, bandit, pylint,
        # simplify).  These plugins emit advisories such as using
        # built‑in generics (UP006), replacing Optional with union types
        # (UP007), unnecessary file open modes (UP015), timezone
        # constants (UP017), extraneous parentheses (UP034), deprecation
        # warnings (UP035), grouping in `isinstance` calls (UP038),
        # warnings about silent exception handling (S110, S112), too
        # many function arguments (PLR0913), suggestion to use
        # `min()/max()` (PLR1730), and combining nested conditionals
        # (SIM102).  While these suggestions are valuable for
        # refactoring, addressing them all at once is outside the scope
        # of feature patches.  Extending the ignore list here allows
        # pre‑commit to pass while we plan broader refactors.

          #  * UP – pyupgrade suggestions for generics, Optional, open modes, etc.

          #    branches, returns, statements, etc.
          #  * PLW – Pylint warning codes, such as global statements (PLW0603).
