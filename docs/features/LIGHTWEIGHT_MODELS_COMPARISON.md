## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: **DistilBERT**

**Why:**
- **50% GPU memory reduction** (400 MB vs 800 MB)
- **2x faster inference** (120 vs 60 items/sec)
- **Acceptable accuracy** (~87% vs 94%, 7% drop)
- Still transformer-based (contextual understanding)
- Well-optimized for production use

**When to use:**
- Default sentiment model for all market hours
- News headlines and press releases
- High-frequency classification (>100 items/cycle)

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly lower accuracy on complex financial jargon
- May miss subtle nuances in SEC filings or analyst reports

**Configuration:**
```ini
SENTIMENT_MODEL_NAME=distilbert
```

---

### Secondary Recommendation: **VADER-only Mode (Market Closed)**

**Why:**
- **100% GPU savings** (CPU-only)
- **200x faster** than any GPU model
- Sufficient accuracy for overnight news and filings
- Allows GPU to be freed completely

**When to use:**
- Market closed hours (8pm - 4am ET)
- Pre-market warmup (4am - 7:30am ET)
- Low-priority background scanning

**Trade-offs:**
- ~30% lower accuracy vs FinBERT
- No contextual understanding
- May misclassify complex sentiment

**Configuration:**
```ini
# Market closed hours
CLOSED_DISABLE_ML=1
SENTIMENT_MODEL_NAME=vader
```

---

### Advanced: **Hybrid Approach** (Recommended for Production)

Combine DistilBERT (market hours) with VADER (market closed) for optimal GPU efficiency:

**Strategy:**
1. **Market Open (9:30am-4pm ET):** DistilBERT + LLM + Full Features
2. **Extended Hours (4am-9:30am, 4pm-8pm ET):** DistilBERT only (disable LLM)
3. **Market Closed (8pm-4am ET):** VADER only (disable GPU models)

**Expected GPU Usage:**
- **Open:** 60% reduction vs current (DistilBERT + optimizations)
- **Extended:** 80% reduction (no LLM)
- **Closed:** 100% reduction (CPU-only)

**Overall:** ~75% average GPU usage reduction across 24 hours

---

## Implementation Guide

### Option 1: Switch to DistilBERT

**Steps:**
1. Update `.env`:
   ```ini
   SENTIMENT_MODEL_NAME=distilbert
   SENTIMENT_BATCH_SIZE=10
   ```

2. First run will download model (~255 MB)

3. Monitor accuracy vs current FinBERT baseline

**Expected Impact:**
- 50% less VRAM usage
- 2x faster sentiment scoring
- 5-7% accuracy reduction (acceptable)

---

### Option 2: VADER-only Mode (Market Closed)

**Steps:**
1. Update `.env`:
   ```ini
   CLOSED_DISABLE_ML=1  # Existing setting
   SENTIMENT_MODEL_NAME=vader  # Fallback
   ```

2. Ensure `FEATURE_MARKET_HOURS_DETECTION=1` is enabled

3. Bot will automatically switch to VADER when market closed

**Expected Impact:**
- 100% GPU savings during closed hours (~16 hours/day)
- ~67% overall GPU reduction (weighted by time)

---

### Option 3: Hybrid (Best of Both Worlds)

**Steps:**
1. Modify `src/catalyst_bot/ml/model_switcher.py` to add time-based logic:
   ```python
   def get_adaptive_model():
       from catalyst_bot.config import get_market_status
       status = get_market_status()

       if status == "open":
           return "distilbert"
       elif status == "extended":
           return "distilbert"
       else:  # closed
           return "vader"
   ```

2. Update sentiment scoring to use adaptive model

3. Configure `.env`:
   ```ini
   FEATURE_ADAPTIVE_SENTIMENT=1
   SENTIMENT_MODEL_OPEN=distilbert
   SENTIMENT_MODEL_CLOSED=vader
   ```

**Expected Impact:**
- ~75% average GPU reduction
- Maintains high accuracy during market hours
- Zero GPU usage overnight

---

## Testing Plan

### 1. Accuracy Testing

Compare FinBERT vs DistilBERT on recent headlines:

```bash
python -m catalyst_bot.ml.model_switcher --benchmark
```

Expected output:
- Per-model accuracy on 100 recent headlines
- Disagreement rate between models
- Recommended model based on accuracy/speed trade-off

### 2. Performance Testing

Profile GPU usage and inference speed:

```bash
python -m catalyst_bot.gpu_profiler --mode sentiment --sentiment-model distilbert
python -m catalyst_bot.gpu_profiler --mode sentiment --sentiment-model finbert
```

Expected output:
- VRAM usage comparison
- Inference speed (items/sec)
- Batch processing speedup

### 3. Production Testing

Run bot with DistilBERT for 24 hours:

1. Enable DistilBERT: `SENTIMENT_MODEL_NAME=distilbert`
2. Monitor alert quality (false positives/negatives)
3. Track GPU usage with `gpu_monitor.py`
4. Compare alert precision/recall vs FinBERT baseline

**Success Criteria:**
- <10% increase in false positives
- 50%+ reduction in GPU memory usage
- 2x+ faster cycle times

---

## Fallback Plan

If DistilBERT accuracy is unacceptable:

1. **Option A:** Use RoBERTa Twitter (middle ground)
   - Better accuracy than DistilBERT
   - Still 30% faster than FinBERT

2. **Option B:** Keep FinBERT but optimize usage
   - Batch size 20 instead of 10
   - Skip sentiment for low-priority sources
   - Use FinBERT only for alerts (not all items)

3. **Option C:** Hybrid FinBERT + VADER
   - FinBERT for high-priority sources (BusinessWire, GlobeNewswire)
   - VADER for low-priority sources (Accesswire, social media)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Quantized Models (INT8)

Use model quantization to reduce size/memory by 75%:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import torch

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("ProsusAI/finbert")
model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)
```

**Benefits:**
- 75% memory reduction (440 MB -> 110 MB)
- 2-3x faster inference
- <1% accuracy loss

**Requires:**
- PyTorch 1.10+
- Additional testing for accuracy validation

### ONNX Runtime Optimization

Convert models to ONNX format for optimized inference:

```bash
python -m transformers.onnx --model=ProsusAI/finbert onnx/finbert/
```

**Benefits:**
- 30-50% faster inference
- Lower memory footprint
- Cross-platform optimization

### Custom Financial Sentiment Model

Fine-tune DistilBERT on financial dataset:

1. Collect labeled financial headlines (10,000+)
2. Fine-tune DistilBERT on domain-specific data
3. Achieve FinBERT-level accuracy with DistilBERT speed

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days + GPU for training

---

## Conclusion

**Immediate Action:** Switch to DistilBERT for 50% GPU reduction with minimal accuracy impact.

**Short-term:** Implement hybrid approach (DistilBERT + VADER) for 75% overall GPU savings.

**Long-term:** Explore quantization and ONNX optimization for additional 2-3x performance gains.

**Expected GPU Usage After Implementation:**
- Current: 100% (baseline)
- DistilBERT only: 50%
- Hybrid approach: 25%
- With quantization: 15%

**Total potential GPU savings: 85%**
