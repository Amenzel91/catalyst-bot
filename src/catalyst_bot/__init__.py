"""Catalyst bot package.

This package contains all of the core functionality for the catalyst bot,
including RSS ingestion, deduplication, classification, market data
adapters, chart rendering, alert delivery, trade simulation, and the
end‑of‑day/premarket analyzer. The package is designed to be modular so
that individual components can be tested and evolved independently.
