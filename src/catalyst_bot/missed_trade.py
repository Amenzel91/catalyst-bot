missed_trade.py
================

This module contains utilities for identifying missed trading opportunities.

Patch B of the Catalyst Bot upgrade introduces a new feature to analyze
trades that were not executed but would have met specified criteria
(e.g. price movement thresholds).  The functions provided here are
placeholders and should be extended to implement custom missed‑trade
analysis logic.  They operate on pandas DataFrames that represent
processed event records and price history.

Usage:
    from catalyst_bot.missed_trade import identify_missed_trades
    missed = identify_missed_trades(events_df, price_history)

The return value is a DataFrame of missed trade instances with
columns describing the symbol, date, potential return, and other
user‑defined metrics.  Currently the function returns an empty
DataFrame as a stub.

    """Identify missed trades based on event signals and price history.

    Parameters
    ----------
    events_df : pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame of executed or candidate events with at least a
        'symbol' column and a 'date' column.  Additional columns like
        'signal' or 'confidence' may be used by future implementations.
    price_history : pandas.DataFrame, optional
        Historical price data keyed by symbol and date.  If provided,
        this function could examine price movements following each
        event to determine if an unexecuted trade would have met the
        desired return threshold.
    threshold : float, optional
        Minimum return (as a decimal) that qualifies a missed trade.  For
        example, 0.05 represents 5% upside.
    window_days : int, optional
        Number of days after the event date during which a qualifying
        return must occur to count as a missed trade.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        Currently returns an empty DataFrame with expected columns.
        Future versions should return a DataFrame with columns such as
        'symbol', 'event_date', 'max_return', 'hit', etc.
